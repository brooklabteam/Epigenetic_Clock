# The dataframe (df) should be organized with rows = samples, columns = CpGs,... 
# ...and a few metadata columns that need to be removed before clock training.

# A rough outline of the function is:
# (1) Randomly select samples from discrete age groups for the model training set (â‰ˆ80%).
# (2) Filter training set to get testing set matrix.
# (3) Apply elastic net regression to train age prediction model using training data
# (4) Predict ages with the model in the testing set
# (5) Gather stats, write clock coefficeints, plot results.
